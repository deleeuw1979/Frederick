The images and js are embedded in the HTML file. Although this is not as per best practices, and does make debugging difficult, 
the idea of having just one file makes the game more "portable", where only one file needs to be copied, as opposed to remembering to copy over images and js folders.
The game interface uses the mouse, but at one time also had touch commands.
